COMMENT_EXPECTED_BLOCKS = """
I think there is some randomness to it. --depth gives you the last
layers in the topological sorting of the DAG, which I believe is
stored by rank.
I'm not sure about the details, for example if we have
`G<-B1, G<-B2, B1<-B3` then G is rank 0, B1 and B2 are rank 1 and
B3 is rank 2. But we could also argue that a depth of 1 should
return B3 and B2.

Whatever --depth does, the layout of the DAG depends on how the
gossiping went when you did you proposals. If you did it real slow,
one by one, then you might have a chain of 8 blocks
(for example `G<-A1<-B1<-B2<-C1<-B3<-C2<-C3`), all linear;
but if you did it in perfect parallelism you could have all of them
branch out and be only 4 levels deep
(`G<-A1, G<-B1, G<-C1, [A1,B1,C1]<-C2`, etc).
