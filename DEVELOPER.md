## Building and running

TBD

__Note__ Successfully building from source requires attending to all of the prerequisites shown below. When users experience errors, it is typically related to failure to assure all prerequisites are met. Work is in progress to improve this experience.

### Prerequisites
* Java Development Kit (JDK), version 8. We recommend using the OpenJDK
* [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html)

#### Development environment on macOS

TBD

#### Development environment on Ubuntu and Debian
```
TBD
```

#### Development environment on Fedora
```
TBD
```

#### Development environment on ArchLinux
You can use `pacaur` or other AUR installer instead of [`trizen`](https://github.com/trizen/trizen).
```
TBD
```

#### <a name="build-bnfc-with-stack"></a> Building BNFC with [`stack`](https://docs.haskellstack.org)

#### Building and running
TBD

Example
```

```

## Information for developers
Assure prerequisites shown above are met.

### Developer Quick-Start

When working in a single project, scope all `sbt` commands to that project. The most effective way is to maintain a running `sbt` instance, invoked from the project root:
```
$ sbt
[info] Loading settings from plugins.sbt ...
[info] Loading global plugins from /home/kirkwood/.sbt/1.0/plugins
[info] Loading settings from plugins.sbt,protoc.sbt ...
[info] Loading project definition from /home/kirkwood/src/rchain/project
[info] Loading settings from build.sbt ...
[info] Set current project to rchain (in build file:/home/kirkwood/src/rchain/)
[info] sbt server started at local:///home/kirkwood/.sbt/1.0/server/e6a65c30ec6e52272d3a/sock
sbt:rchain> project rspace
[info] Set current project to rspace (in build file:/home/kirkwood/src/rchain/)
sbt:rspace> compile
[... compiling rspace ...]
```
but single-line commands work, too:
```
$ sbt "project rspace" clean compile test
```
or
```
$ sbt rspace/clean rspace/compile rspace/test
```

### Building

The build is organized into several, mostly autonomous projects. These projects may be built (and used!) on their own, or they may be combined together to form the full node package. The build process in any case is contained in and controlled by a single, top-level `build.sbt` file. This process is able to produce several different kinds of artifacts, including JAR files (for Scala) and Docker images.

The most up-to-date code is found in the `dev` branch. This brilliant, cutting-edge source is periodically merged into `master`, which branch should represent a more stable, tested version.

#### Whole-project Build

Please check the prerequistes on your machine if the code generation fails.
Then build the whole project with all submodules:
```
> sbt compile
```

#### Packaging
To publish a docker image to your local repo run:
```
> sbt node/docker:publishLocal
[... output snipped ...]
[info] Step 8/8 : ENTRYPOINT ["\/bin\/main.sh"]
[info]  ---> Running in 2ac7f835192d
[info] Removing intermediate container 2ac7f835192d
[info]  ---> 5e79e6d92528
[info] Successfully built 5e79e6d92528
[info] Tagging image 5e79e6d92528 with name: casperlabs/node
[success] Total time: 35 s, completed May 24, 2018 10:19:14 AM
```

Check the local docker repo:
```
> docker images
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
casperlabs/node   latest              5e79e6d92528        7 minutes ago       143MB
<none>              <none>              e9b49f497dd7        47 hours ago        143MB
openjdk             8u151-jre-alpine    b1bd879ca9b3        4 months ago        82MB
```

To deploy a tarball run:
```
> sbt node/universal:packageZipTarball
```

The tarball can be found in directory `node/target/universal/`

#### Running
```
TBD
```
Now after you've done some local changes and want to test them, simply run the last command `tbd` again. It will kill the running app and start a new instance containing latest changes in a completely new forked JVM.

#### Running tests in IntelliJ

For tests of the Rholang module, make sure you've got the following JVM options set in your Run Configuration:
`-Xss240k -XX:MaxJavaStackTraceDepth=10000 -Xmx128m`

Otherwise the StackSafetySpec is going to be veeery slow and will most likely fail due to timeouts.

You can make the above options default by editing the ScalaTest Template in `Run > Edit configurations > Templates`.  

### Cross-developing for Linux (e.g. Ubuntu) on a Mac
You will need a virtual machine running the appropriate version of Linux.
1. Install [VirtualBox]( https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
2. Install the Linux distribution you need (e.g. [Ubuntu](http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/ubuntu-16.04.4-server-amd64.iso))
3. Start VirtualBox and create a new virtual machine in the manager
4. Boot your virtual machine using the Linux distribution ISO installed in step 2.
5. Configure your Linux VM as desired. You may need to install additional tools sucah as g++, g++-multilib, make, git, etc.

For a more convenient experience, you can share a folder on your Mac with the virtual machine. To do this you will need to install the VirtualBox Guest Additions. Unfortunately there are some gotchas with this. You may need to utilize one of these [solutions](https://askubuntu.com/questions/573596/unable-to-install-guest-additions-cd-image-on-virtual-box).
